This app is used to route data from a non-connected internet computer
to the smart phone running it, essentially proxying all packet data
(including DNS) to allow internet access via Bluetooth.

NOTE: This project was in the works and work was halted when bluetooth
tethering became a standard option on most Android smart phones.  This
code is left for reference or for anyone to work with.

Please contact neillm@thecodefactory.org regarding your usage and the
license that it's under if you choose to use any part of it for any
reason.
