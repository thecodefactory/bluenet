This module is intended to run on the computer that is NOT connected
to the internet, but that wishes to gain access via BlueTooth
connection to Android Smartphone running the BlueNet app.

To build, run:

ant

To run, use the following:

java -jar dist/BlueNetConnect.jar

If you see this error when trying to run the above command:

"Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no unix-java in java.library.path"

Try this alternate command instead:

java -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni -jar dist/BlueNetConnect.jar

System requirements:

Bluetooth hardware supported by the Bluecove library.

The following package (as named on Ubuntu) libunixsocket-java is
required and must be installed.


Troubleshooting:

On Windows 7, it always detected the winsock driver, but I knew I should be using the widcomm driver.  To fix this, download the broadcomm driver:

http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php

The setup program stalled while detecting the internal bluetooth device.  To remedy this so that the driver could be installed, I had to insert a USB bluetooth device during the detection.  The installation continued at that point and proceeded to finish.

On Android Device: If the app freezes during Initialization, please try disabling bluetooth first and trying again.  If that does not work, please restart your phone, as the bluetooth subsystem appears to be in a state that is not working for BlueNet.

On GNU/Linux systems, you may encounter the following errors:

Exception in thread "Thread-1" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no unix-java in java.library.path

This error usually indicates that the Java Unix socket libraries are
not installed on the system.  Under Ubuntu for example, the required
package name to install is libunixsocket-java.

"Exception in thread "main" javax.bluetooth.BluetoothStateException: Failed to connect to bus Connection refused"

In this case, remove the contents of /var/run/dbus/*, for example:

mv /var/run/dbus/* /tmp

And then restart dbus:

service dbus restart [ OR /etc/init.d/dbus restart ]

Also, make sure that bluetoothd is running (start it manually if
necessary), or else you may see the below error:

"SEVERE: Failed to execute BlueNetConnect: org.freedesktop.DBus$Error$ServiceUnknown: The name org.bluez was not provided by any .service files"



"javax.bluetooth.BluetoothStateException: Can't find default adapter"

Please make sure that your computer has a working bluetooth adapter,
and that it's connected.
